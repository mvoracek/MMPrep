Part 1
======
Watch “Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals” at Lynda.com and then answer
the following questions:

1. Imagine asking a friend to meet you at a restaurant. What instructions would 
   a computer program need that your friend would not in order to understand how
   to get there?
   
A computer program needs instructions in a specific computer language, using proper syntax and organization, that would guide the computer program to this specific place.


2. What is the difference between source code and machine code? What does the
   CPU do? Where are instructions and data stored?
   
Source code is instructions written by a programmer in a high-level and easy to understand language that can be translated into machine code. Machine code is a series of numerical operations that run directly onto a computer's hardware, or CPU. The CPU only understands machine code and needs higher-level languages processed to machine code so it can run applications.

I am not sure what is meant by the question "Where are instructions and data stored?". I guess they are stored on the computer? 


3. What is an IDE and why is it useful?

An Integrated Development Environment is a code editor often specific to a computer language with additional features given to make writing code easier and with less mistakes. 


4. What kind of a language is Objective-C? Why do you think we use it for making
   device specific applications? Why wouldn't we want to use an interpreted
   language for making iPhone and iPad apps?
   
Objective C is a compiled language. We use it for making device specific applications because it can run quickly while being used for only Apple-made devices. Interpreted languages need an interpreter to run the program which causes the program to run slower. Also an interpreter would make our source code public, which may not be to our benefit.
